    <h2>External and Internal CSS</h2>
    <p>
      So, before I show you how I did the thing with the font,<br />
      I'll explain Ex. and Int. CSS.<br />
      So Internal CSS, is written in the source-code for <b>one</b> page,<br />
      the trick I did with the Font was achieved with Internal CSS use.<br />
      What if you want to have a bunch of setting that you can just<br />
      copy and paste onto every page you ever make...ever?<br />
      Well, that's when you'd use External CSS,<br />
      if you've been paying attention you'll'd've (that's right, "you'll'd've" is a real word)<br />
      noticed that all of the pages on this site look the same,<br />
      that's due to the Style Sheet I've been linking into the <code>&lt;head&gt;</code> of each page.<br />
      That style sheet is called "../css/Style1.css" (go find it in the source-code).<br />
      That .css file has all the info on what I want the page to look like,<br />
      throwing a link into the head of each file is way faster than<br />
      typing up EVERY. SINGLE. CHANGE. into EVERY. SINGLE. PAGE.</p>
      <p id="Demo">Groovy, huh?</p><br /><br />
      <u><b>Examples:</b></u><p><br /><br /><br />

        <u>The <i>external</i> link looks like this:</u><br /><br />
        <code>
          &lt;head&gt;
            &lt;title&gt;More CSS...&lt;/title&gt;
               &lt;link href="../css/Style1.css" type="text/css" rel="stylesheet" /&gt;
         &lt;/head&gt;</code><br />
         (The link is the bit within the "Link" tag)<br />
         I gave you the entire head section too look at so you know <b>Where</b> that link goes.<br /><br />


           <u>The <i>internal stuff looks like this:</i></u><br /><br />

           <code>&lt;head&gt;
             &lt;title&gt;More CSS...&lt;/title&gt;
             &lt;style type="text/css"&gt;
                   p#Demo {
                     color: rgb(255, 170, 294);
                     font-family: cursive;
                     font-size: 150%
                   }
                &lt;/style&gt;
           &lt;/head&gt;</code><br />
           Once again I gave you the whole head section so you can see what's where,<br />
           Now, this is really straight-forward, "<code>p#Demo</code>" is our selector (thing we wanna change)<br />
           and if you take a look under it, you can see that I messed with<br />
           the color, the kind of font and the size of the font, but that's only half of what went on.<br />
           The other half of that change looks like this...<br /><br />
           <code>&lt;p id="Demo"&gt;Ooh look! this sentence is in a different color and the font is HUGE!?&lt;/p&gt;</code><br />
           Note that the <code>&lt;p&gt;</code> tag matches the Selector (aiming it directly at <b>that</b> line)<br />
