    <h2>External and Internal CSS</h2>
    <p>
      So, before I show you how I did the thing with the font,<br />
      I'll explain Ex. and Int. CSS.<br />
      So Internal CSS, is written in the source-code for <b>one</b> page,<br />
      the trick I did with the Font was achieved with Internal CSS use.<br />
      What if you want to have a bunch of setting that you can just<br />
      copy and paste onto every page you ever make...ever?<br />
      Well, that's when you'd use External CSS,<br />
      if you've been paying attention you'll'd've (that's right, "you'll'd've" is a real word)<br />
      noticed that all of the pages on this site look the same,<br />
      that's due to the Style Sheet I've been linking into the <code>&lt;head&gt;</code> of each page.<br />
      That style sheet is called "../css/Style1.css" (go find it in the source-code).<br />
      That .css file has all the info on what I want the page to like,<br />
      throwing a link into the head of each file is way faster than<br />
      typing up EVERY. SINGLE. CHANGE. into EVERY. SINGLE. PAGE.</p>
      <p id="Demo">Groovy, huh?</p>
