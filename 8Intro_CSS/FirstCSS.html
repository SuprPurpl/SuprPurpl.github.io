<div><u><h2>What is CSS?</h2></u><br />
<p>A'ight, "CSS", Cascading Style Sheet.<br />
  Basically, this is what's going to decided what your page looks like,<br />
  font, colors, spacing, borders, backgrounds...<br />
  You name it, CSS decideds how its gonna look.<br /><br />
  So, CSS works using a "Selector" and a "Declaration",<br />
  in normal people speak, you <b>choose</b> the thing you want to look a certain way,<br />
  then you say <b>how</b> you intend to change it.<br />
  Capeesh?<br /><br />
  <u>Example:</u><br /><br /></div>
  <code>p {font-family: Arial;}</code><br /><br />
  So, that "<code>p</code>", is the same as "<code>&lt;p&gt;</code>",<br />
  eveything between that tag will be displayed as simple old text.<br />
  That "<code>p</code>", is your Selector, anything that occurs between the tags will changed<br />
  as you dictate with your declaration.<br />
  So, the whole, "<code>{font-family: Arial;}</code>" bit is your Declaration,<br />
  the above declaration just controls font...baby steps, right?</p>
  <p id="Demo">Ooh look! this sentence is in a different color and the font is HUGE!?</p>
  <p>So, I directly chose that sentence to break from the normal style of the page,<br />
    let me show you how...<br /><br /></p>
